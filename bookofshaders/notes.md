# Notes
Each thread is blind and memoryless.

*Uniforms* are instructions from the CPU. They are read only and are the same for all threads

gl_FracCoord er ikke en konstant eller Uniform. Den kalles en varying

When adding a shader to processing the error 
"is calling TIS/TSM in non-main thread environment, ERROR : This is NOT allowed. Please call TIS/TSM in main thread!!!" is shown. this is just a notice and is of no importance. It will be fixed in the next release of Processing.
